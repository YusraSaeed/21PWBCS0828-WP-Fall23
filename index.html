        <h2>Portfolio</h2>
        <h2>Project Title: E-commerce Website</h2>
        <h2>Project Title: AI Powered Chatbot Without Programming</h2>
        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>As the number of social media apps is increasing and more businesses are shifting online, we 
            need a mechanism to provide customer service 24/7. A human agent might be suitable for assisting
            however, for every small and repeated query, contacting an agent and waiting for the response seems
            unefficient. This is where <b>Chatbots</b> come in handy. Deploying a chatbot in one's site 
            can provide room for answering simple and most frequently asked  queries without having to wait for a 
            human agent to do so. The project revolves around creating an <b>AI Powered Chatbot</b> for a flower
            shop to answer simple queries without the use of any programming. The project aims at improving the 
            quality of customer service. </p>

        <h3>Technology Used</h3>
        <p>The project revoles around the use of IBM Watson Assitant for creating 
        and deploying the chatbot to a WordPress site. I used the its features to create a simple chatbot. Below 
        is a picture of how the chatbot would normally operate.</p>

        <h2>Project Title: Mood Recognition with Machine Learning</h2>
        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>The project revolves around training an <b>Image Classifier</b> in a way
        that it can distinguish between <b>Happy</b> and <b>Sad faces</b>. For this purpose, I first collected dataset 
        in the form of pictures from different Internet resources  for both the classes i.e. Happy and 
        Sad. The dataset consisted of both the training and testing data. I then used the training data 
        to train my modal and then lastly I tested it with the already collected dataset.</p>

        <h3>Technology Used</h3>
        <p>To train the modal, I used an Image Classifier</p>
        <img src = "Project2picture1.png" alt = "Project Picture" width = "900" height="400">
        <p>Next, I trained the modal by creating two classes and adding training data to both of them.</p>
        <img src = "Project2picture2.png" alt = "Project Picture" width = "900" height="400">
        <p>Finally, to test the modal, I uploaded pictures of both classes one by one and as expected, 
            the classifier classified them correctly (see screenshots below).</p>
